        <p>Thank you for using Violet PWM, a personal password manager designed to securely store your passwords and sensitive information. This project has been a labor of love for many years, and I am thrilled to share it with you.</p>

        <p>Violet PWM is an open-source project, continually expanding with new ideas and improvements. It's easy to set up, doesn't require fancy OOP programming, and works on all systems that can serve files. Unlike other password managers like Firefox and LastPass, which have faced security breaches and have introduced paid plans, Violet PWM will always remain free and focused on your privacy and security.</p>

        <p>If you find Violet PWM helpful and would like to support its ongoing development and maintenance, please consider making a small donation. Your contribution helps cover miscellaneous expenses and keeps me motivated to continue improving the project and incorporating new features.</p>

        <p>Donations can be made via PayPal: <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=T8FHWDSPU88X8" target="_blank">Donate</a></p>
		<p>Or just buy me a coffee then I can program in "hyper" mode :-) <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/ricksprojects" target="_blank">Buy Me Coffee</a></p>

        <p>Thank you for your support and for being a part of the Violet PWM community.</p>
